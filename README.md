Here are the main files of a group study on the impact on coverage of Medicaid's expansion in Virginia. 
Those two files are a Quarto markdown which corresponds to the R Notebook that we used during the project and the file 'bdd_finale.csv'.
The database has been created by the merging of CPS-ASEC databases from 2017 to 2024 and contains individual in Virginia and South Carolina that are eligible for Medicaid. 
The Notebook is structured in the following way : 
1.  An introduction
2. and 3. The creation of 'bdd_finale.csv', if you want to run it you will have to get CPS-ASEC at person and household scale by yourself
4. Summary statistics, sorry this is a bit messy here.
5. Finally the analysis that comport test of hypothesis of a diff in diff and our regressions

Note that in the file output you also have some table in latex that comes from the R markdown.
